= Help! I forgot my password (Or dont know it to begin with) =
Upon activation, The Superuser password is set to that of the user who activated it. Its advised to change this by visiting the su options page.
If for some reason, You forget the password you have set for Su, Simply uninstall the plugin through FTP, and re-install it, it'll inherit your accounts password automatically.
